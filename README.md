Play 1v1 a dice game.

Rules are simple!
1. Each Player rolls the dice as many times as he wants and each time the dice is added to his current score!
2. If a player presses the hold button, then his current score is added to his total score, then it's next player's time to play!
3. If the rolled dice is '1' , the current player loses his turn and the next one continues!
4. First player to reach and hold 100 points to his total score wins the game!

Have fun!!!
